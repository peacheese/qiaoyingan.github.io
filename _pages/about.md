Hi, there! ðŸ‘‹

I am a first year graduate student from the [Institute of Computing Technology](http://www.ict.ac.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.cas.cn/). My research interest includes computer network, recommendation system, machine learning and hardware acceleration.

I did my undergraduate studies in the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/). During my undergraduate career, I worked on a number of projects on computer networks, artificial neural networks, graphics and cryptograph.
